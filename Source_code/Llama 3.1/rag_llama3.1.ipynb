      "The patient's history of multiple falls and osteoporosis, as well as her recent hip fracture, increase her risk of readmission. Additionally, the patient's age and recent surgery may also contribute to her risk of readmission. However, the patient's recent physical therapy and rehabilitation efforts may have improved her functional status, which may reduce her risk of readmission. Overall, the patient's chances of readmission are difficult to predict without further information, but her history and recent hospital stay suggest a moderate\n"

      "Given the patient's chronic liver disease, portal hypertension, and history of hepatic encephalopathy, there is a potential risk for readmission due to complications such as worsening encephalopathy, gastrointestinal bleeding, or worsening liver function. The patient's history of cocaine intoxication and alcohol withdrawal also increases the risk for readmission.
